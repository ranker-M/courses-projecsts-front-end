<h1>FCC Exercise Tracker Project Solution</h1>

I used replit boilarplate of the fcc to solve this challenge. You can see challenge by clicking header, which is Eercise Tracker. You can run project by visiting [this](https://replit.com/@ranker-M/boilerplate-project-exercisetracker-1) replit workspace or upload these files to any replit workspace. You need to connect another database to make it work though.
