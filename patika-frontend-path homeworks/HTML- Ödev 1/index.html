    <h2>My Favorite TV Series</h2>

    <!-- The boys -->
    <h3>The Boys</h3>
    <p>I recently started watching this series and love it.</p>
    <p> I watched first 6 episodes of season 1 I didn't see the
        season final right now but I like how the show approach people with superior powers to others. </p>

    <!-- Invincible -->
    <h3>Invincible</h3>
    <p> Similar to the Boys. Invincible is the first serie I watched in this genre, I mean shows that trying to answer
        what realy would happen to world if heroes were true. It is animation yet it is okay. Graphics are good also
        there are lots of carnage scenes so it should be animation I think. </p>
