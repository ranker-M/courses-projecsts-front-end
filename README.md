# What is this repo ?

This repo contains homeworks and projects that i have done while I was **learning front-end development** from **courses**. Bootcamps and relatively big proejects will have different repos.

## Why this repo needed?

To **share** my homeworks with courses. Many courses **check progress** and **their homeworks** via **github**.

Many projects in this repo probably **won't** be too **complicated or large**. These projects are for **learning and practising purpose**.

But these projects will **show** my **progress and activity** as a programmer.

## File Names

File names display the reason and root of the projects.
